    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Now found exclusively at one well-known pizza garden in Gravesend, 
        Brooklyn, this style of pizza was once found in neighborhood bakeries.</p>

    <p>This pizza is deceivingly light, crisp, and slightly spicy. Enjoy with a can of soda.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons fine salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.\        </li>
        <li>Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.        </li>
    </ol>
